# Legal Text Classification Project

## Project Description

This project involves building a machine learning pipeline for classifying legal case texts based on their outcomes using PySpark. It includes data loading, preprocessing, and partitioning of the dataset, followed by feature extraction with TF-IDF and training a logistic regression model. The project also includes data analysis such as word frequency counts, case text length distribution, and visualizations like bar plots, word clouds, and ROC curves. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and multiclass ROC curves. Additionally, PCA is applied for dimensionality reduction and visualization of feature space.
